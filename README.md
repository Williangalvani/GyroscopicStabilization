Attempt at creating a gyrocope-stabilized motorbike.

The code is heavily based on the work by MatthiasWientapper at http://mattzz.no-ip.org/wiki/Projects/PlayingWithInertialMeasurementUnits

The first version of the hardware was designed by Mateus Abreu de Andrade at http://mateusabreu.esy.es/projeto-instrumentacao-e-controle/

A video of the working system can be watched [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Axc3NbXdgI)
